The idea of this example is to show that MDFF is able to 
reproduce published results. 
Here we reproduce figure 1 of PRB 68, 144202 (2003) by J. Hernandez-Rojas and D. J. Wales.

reduced_units are used

For different densities (0.6 <= rho <= 1.3) 
NVE runs are done on N=256 Binary Mixture 
Lennard-Jones (Kob-Andersen model)  T=1 (10^5 equilibration 10^6 NVE)
after the production run 1000 configurations are 
optimized locally every 1000 steps (by m1qn3 method) 
we plot the average potential energy and pressure over the 1000 
inherent structures in function of the density

the calculation is about 5h long
