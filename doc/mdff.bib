  abstract = {QUANTUM ESPRESSO is an integrated suite of computer codes for electronic-structure
	calculations and materials modeling, based on density-functional
	theory, plane waves, and pseudopotentials (norm-conserving, ultrasoft,
	and projector-augmented wave). The acronym ESPRESSO stands for opEn
	Source Package for Research in Electronic Structure, Simulation,
	and Optimization. It is freely available to researchers around the
	world under the terms of the GNU General Public License. QUANTUM
	ESPRESSO builds upon newly-restructured electronic-structure codes
	that have been developed and tested by some of the original authors
	of novel electronic-structure algorithms and applied in the last
	twenty years by some of the leading materials modeling groups worldwide.
	Innovation and efficiency are still its main focus, with special
	attention paid to massively parallel architectures, and a great effort
	being devoted to user friendliness. QUANTUM ESPRESSO is evolving
	towards a distribution of independent and interoperable codes in
	the spirit of an open-source project, where researchers active in
	the field of electronic-structure calculations are encouraged to
	participate in the project by contributing their own codes or by
	implementing their own ideas into existing codes.},
